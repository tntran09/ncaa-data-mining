A collection of project to analyze NCAA Men's Basketball data to predict March Madness

# DataMining.Scraper
Windows Form application that scrapes raw stats from espn.com

# DataMining.Simulate
Uses WEKA command line to run a neural network analysis on the training data and produce output. The output is used with the actual tournament draw to perform a simulation for each round. Flags can be altered to simulate on the same training data that was analyzed or the current year's test set

# DataMining.Transform
Console application that transforms the 'finish' attribute in the data set by one or more functions. The intent is to test different values for finishing in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc round to find the function that performs optimally on the test set

# DataMining.Utilities
Miscellaneous utility classes

# Future
- A project to aggregate, analyze, or visualize simulation results
- A project to interactively run simulations. Can be combined with above
- A project to visualize test data before running simulations
